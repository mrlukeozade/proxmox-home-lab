# Proxmox Home Lab Server

## Overview
This project documents the setup of a Proxmox Virtual Environment (VE) server used as a home lab for hosting and managing virtual machines. The goal was to create a centralised, reliable virtualisation platform to support learning, testing, and future IT and cybersecurity projects. Installed Proxmox VE on a old Mac Pro 2013 machine which has 24 vCPU's and 128GB RAM which is perfect for my homelab setup.

## What I Did
- Installed Proxmox VE on dedicated home lab hardware
- Configured networking and storage for virtual machines
- Created and managed virtual machines within Proxmox
- Implemented basic security and access controls with PAM
- Tested VM deployment and management functionality
- Uploaded ISO's for windows server, linux, pfsense and also the proxmox drivers.

## Tools & Technologies
- Proxmox VE
- Virtual Machines (Linux & Windows)
- Web-based management interface
- Home lab server hardware
- Networking (bridged networking)

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Virtualisation and hypervisor management
- Linux-based system administration
- Network configuration and troubleshooting
- Resource management (CPU, memory, storage)
- Secure system setup and access control

## Outcome
A fully functional Proxmox home lab server capable of hosting multiple virtual machines for testing, learning, and future projects such as Windows Server, Active Directory, and cybersecurity labs.
